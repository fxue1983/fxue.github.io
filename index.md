## Welcome to Feng Xue's Hoempage.

Dr. **Feng Xue** is a senior engineer of National Key Laboratory of Science and Technology on Test Physics and Numerical Mathematics, Beijing, 100076, China.

### Short Bio
I received the B.Eng. and M.Eng. from <a href="http://www.hit.edu.cn">Harbin Institute of Technology</a>, Harbin, China, and the Ph.D. degree in electronics engineering from <a href="http://www.cuhk.edu.hk">the Chinese University of Hong Kong</a> (CUHK), Shatin, Hong Kong, in 2013, under the supervision of Prof. <a href="http://www.ee.cuhk.edu.hk/~tblu/monsite/phps/">Thierry Blu</a>. I am currently with the National Key Laboratory of Science and Technology on Test Physics and Numerical Mathematics, Beijing, 100076, China. My research interests include unbiased risk estimation, convex analysis and variational methods with applications to imaging problems.

If you have any problems with my research works, please contact me by email: _fxue (at) hotmail (dot) com_.
